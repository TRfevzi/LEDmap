# LEDmap
Processing and Arduino code for automatic addressable LED mapping

The code here is in two parts - the arduino part and the processing part. You need to flash your arduino compatible microcontroller of choice with the arduino part, then connect to it using the (hopefully) platform independent processing sketch.

There are dependencies - you will need the fastLED library for the arduino part and controlP5 and blobDetect libraries for processing, you quite possibly have all but the blobDetect library already. There are lots of tutorials available elsewhere if you need assistance with installing libraries but it should be very simple with the new library managers.



If you are reading this just now hold your horses, i'm a couple of commits short of first alpha and there's docs to come too
